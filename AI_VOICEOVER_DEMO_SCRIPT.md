**VOICEOVER:**

"Simultaneously, our audio processing pipeline leverages the Web Speech API with continuous speech recognition - converting acoustic signals to text with 95% accuracy through Google's cloud-based ASR engine.

**Watch as multiple NLP systems activate in real-time:**

Our **words-per-minute calculator** tracks speaking pace across temporal windows, comparing against the optimal 130-150 WPM range for professional presentations. The algorithm identifies rushed delivery or hesitant pauses.

The **filler word detection engine** employs regex pattern matching and phonetic analysis to identify and count verbal disfluencies - including 'um', 'uh', 'like', 'you know', 'basically', and 'literally'. Each occurrence is timestamped and categorized by severity.

Our **grammar analysis module** implements a rule-based linguistic parser, scanning for 50+ common grammatical errors including subject-verb disagreement, double negatives, tense inconsistencies, and capitalization mistakes. Each error is flagged with specific correction suggestions.

The **vocabulary enhancement system** uses lexical analysis to identify weak word choices, overused intensifiers, vague language, and informal expressions - recommending stronger, more precise alternatives from our 10,000-word professional vocabulary database.

Finally, our **sentiment analysis engine** performs real-time emotional tone classification, measuring positivity, confidence, nervousness, and authenticity through a trained BERT-based transformer model."
