python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install flask flask-cors opencv-python mediapipe Pillow numpy SpeechRecognition
python app.py
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install flask flask-cors opencv-python mediapipe Pillow numpy SpeechRecognition
python app.py
```

‚úÖ You should see: `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000`
‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep this terminal open!**

## Important Notes

### ‚ö° Both Must Run Simultaneously
- Backend runs on port **5000**
- Frontend runs on port **3000**
- You need **BOTH** running at the same time!

### üé• Permissions
- You MUST allow camera and microphone access
- Click "Allow" when browser asks for permissions

### üåê Best Browser
- **Chrome** or **Edge** (recommended)
- Firefox has limited speech recognition support
- Safari is not recommended

### üì¶ First Time Setup
- Backend: Installing Python packages takes 2-5 minutes
- Frontend: Installing npm packages takes 1-3 minutes
- **Be patient on first run!**

## Troubleshooting

### "Python is not recognized"
1. Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
3. Restart your terminal

### "Node/npm is not recognized"
1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
2. Restart your terminal

### Backend Port 5000 Already in Use
Edit `backend/app.py`, last line:
```python
app.run(debug=True, port=5001, host='0.0.0.0')  # Change to 5001
```

Then edit `frontend/src/App.js`, line 4:
```javascript
const API_URL = 'http://localhost:5001/api';  // Change to 5001
```

### Camera/Microphone Not Working
1. Check browser permissions (click lock icon in address bar)
2. Make sure no other app is using the camera
3. Try reloading the page
4. Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)

### Speech Recognition Not Working
- Must use **Chrome** or **Edge** browser
